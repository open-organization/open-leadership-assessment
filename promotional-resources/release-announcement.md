The Open Organization community is pleased to announce the release of the Open Leadership Assessment.

The Open Leadership Assessment is a tool for determining whether people leading groups, teams, or other organizations are acting in alignment with open organization characteristics and fostering conversations about organizational culture. The tool consists of a pair of survey-style instruments offering leaders and their teams a means of candidly analyzing and discussing the mindsets and behaviors that guide how they work. Leaders complete a survey while reflecting on their leadership practices; at the same time, their teammates complete a similar survey about the leader. Comparing scores from each survey creates opportunities for team conversation and collective improvement. Teams can use the included Guide to Interpreting Results to foster and structure these conversations.

The Open Leadership assessment is available immediately at the following location:

Designed for use in conjunction with both the Open Leadership Definition[^1] and the Open Organization Definition[^2], the Open Leadership Assessment is openly licensed to foster community contribution and enhancement. In that spirit, the Open Organization community invites comment, feedback, and pull requests on the project. The community also welcomes constructive feedback and dialogue in its forum at:
