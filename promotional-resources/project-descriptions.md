## Extended description

The Open Leadership Assessment is a tool for determining whether people leading groups, teams, or other organizations are acting in alignment with characteristics outlined in both the [Open Leadership Definition](https://theopenorganization.org/definition/open-leadership-definition/) and [Open Organization Definition](https://theopenorganization.org/definition/open-organization-definition/).

The tool consists of a pair of survey-style instruments offering leaders and their teams a means of candidly analyzing and discussing the mindsets and behaviors that guide how they work. Leaders complete a survey while reflecting on their leadership practices; at the same time, their teammates complete a similar survey about the leader. Comparing scores from each survey creates opportunities for team conversation and collective improvement. Teams can use the included Guide to Interpreting Results to foster and structure these conversations.

The Open Leadership Assessment is designed to be easily administered. The survey instrument is divided into five sections, each of which consists of ten statements. Respondents record their responses to these statements using a numeric scale, then calculate the sum of those numerical responses. To ease the work of calculation and reporting, users may wish to import the questions into an electronic survey tool of their choosing; however, the tool can function just as well when administered and completed using pencil and paper.
