# Open Leadership Self Survey
Part of the Open Leadership Assessment

This survey assesses the degree to which you are open in your leadership mindsets and behaviors. Based on the [Open Leadership Definition](https://theopenorganization.org/definition/open-leadership-definition/), the survey determines how your leadership style reflects the open organization characteristics of transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community.

> **Note**
> If you would like your colleagues and teammates to assess your leadership style, please ask them to use the Open Leadership Feedback Survey.

## Instructions

| Response | Numerical value |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Never | 1 |

| Sometimes | 3 |

| Always | 5 | 

Completing this survey will require approximately 30 minutes.
